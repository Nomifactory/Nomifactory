Omnifactory is a quest-driven, expert-style tech modpack focused on automating large-scale factories. It features a custom take on GregTechCE-centered progression that we hope everyone will enjoy.

This modpack exists thanks to the efforts of Damien Reave, who is the original author and maintainer through version 1.2.1. Exaxxion assumed the maintainer role in January 2020, and is working collaboratively with members of the Omnifactory Discord community to continue development of the pack.
