This file is for the FluidPocketGenerator. This generator generates pockets of fluid, 
similar to lava pockets in the nether.



Constructor:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData, int, boolean
    Argument Usage:
        block to generate, pockets per chunk, whether it requires air
    Notes:
        This constructs a FluidPocketGenerator. The boolean is for if one side of the pocket must have air, not counting the top. This is so the fluid flows prettily.

addRequiredBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        required block
    Notes:
        Adds a block the generator is allowed to generate a pocket under. By default can generate under any block.

setHeight:
    Arguments:
        int, int
    Usage:
        min height, max height
    Notes:
        Sets the min and max heights this generator can generate at. Default is 4 and 250.
