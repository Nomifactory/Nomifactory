This file is for the DeformedSphereGenerator. This generator generates spheres of 
blocks, which are then deformed using simplex noise. These spheres generate within 
grid regions, and can therefore be any size. 



Constructor:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData, int, int, int, int
    Argument Usage:
        block to generate, grid region size in chunks, radius, generation attempt count, minimum sphere count
    Notes:
        This constructs a DeformedSphereGenerator.

addRequiredBlock:
    Arguments:
        ItemBlockData
    Usage:
        required block
    Notes:
        Adds a block the generator is allowed to generate a sphere within. By default can generate within block.

setDeformScale:
    Arguments:
        double
    Usage:
        scale
    Notes:
        Sets the noise scale used to deform the spheres. Default is 16.0. The higher the number, the more the sphere can be deformed.
