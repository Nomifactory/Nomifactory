This file is for the SkyRendererCustom. This is for making a custom sky renderer.



addSkybox:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        texture location
    Notes:
        Adds a SkyboxRenderer to the sky renderer with the provided texture location and returns it. The texture is used to generate a skybox in the standard format.

addSunMoon:
    Notes:
        Adds the vanilla sun and moon to the sky renderer. Currently cannot set a custom sun/moon texture except by making it part of the skybox texture.
