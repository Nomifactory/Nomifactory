Just ignore the tool\u0027s material in the recipes: it can be whatever you\u0027d like.\n\nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not five).

It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§f frequently used items so you don\u0027t have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§f all at once.\n\n§3Crafting Stations§f are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.\n\nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.\n\nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.\n\nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn\u0027t ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.\n\nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.",

Instead, you will engineer factories to automate the production for you. It is useful to keep a stockpile of frequently used things like circuits and components crafted so you don\u0027t have to wait for them when you need them.\n\n",

The first of which, §6Aluminium§r, is going to be important in the immediate future.\n\nThere is a diagram of how to build the EBF in §bJEI§r. The second and third levels must be a 3x3 square shape of Coil Blocks (§6Cupronickel§r is the only type of coil block you have access to for now) with an empty center. You can also §6sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.\n\nHowever, the bottom and top layers are very flexible. The §6EBF Controller§r must be on the §ebottom layer§r of the structure, and on the §emiddle of an outer edge§r. Otherwise, you can put the hatches and buses wherever you want, filling in all gaps in each layer with §6Heatproof Machine Casings§r. It\u0027s worth noting that you must §euse at least 10 Heatproof Machine Casings in your layout or the structure will not form§r.\n\nThis quest calls for two energy hatches, a fluid input and output, and an item input and output, which is a total of six positions. Their specific order and placement don\u0027t matter, as long as you can access them. The seventh position is your EBF controller, leaving eleven gaps to be filled by Heatproof Machine Casings. If you did everything right, the structure will form: the colors on its hatches and casings will unify, and the controller will say \"Idling.\"\n\nYou\u0027ll most likely want to locate your power quite near to the EBF. It is very power hungry, and if it cannot get enough energy, progress on the current item smelting will start to regress. Be careful to ensure the EBF has enough power, and keep a Soft Hammer nearby to pause it by tapping the controller if you run out of power.",

The way that it works is that each level of the tower after the first will output an additional fluid from the recipe. §cAny output fluids in excess of available buses are voided§r. \n\nWhat you need the Distillation Tower for initially is to break down §9Biomass§r into §9Ethanol§r and §9Water§r. This recipe only has two outputs, so a §ethree-block-high Distillation Tower§r is just fine (the quest materials are for such a tower; if you want to build it bigger, you will need §ean additional 7 casings and 1 fluid output per floor§r).\n\nAny recipe with more than two fluids (like §9Oil§r) will need a larger tower. Make sure to increase the height of your tower to accommodate all of the outputs you want to keep. Also check the voltage requirements of the recipes, as many Distillation Tower recipes need higher voltages than MV. §eYou can swap out your Energy Input for a higher tier one when that time comes§r.\n\nThe tower we\u0027ll be building at first is 3x3x3, with a hollow center. §6Fluid Input Hatch§r §emust go in the very center of the bottom 3x3 layer§r. The §6controller§r goes in the middle of an outer edge of the bottom layer. The §6Output Bus§r and an §6Energy Input Hatch§r can go wherever you can fit them on the bottom layer. The rest of the 3x3 must be filled with §6Clean Stainless Steel Casings§r. Each level above that is a ring of 7 Clean Stainless Steel Casings, one §6Fluid Output§r and nothing in the center, except for the topmost layer which needs an eighth casing to fill in the center, capping off the top.",

          "desc:8": "With §6Aluminium§r, you can replace the two §aLV Energy Input Hatches§r on your Electric Blast Furnace with a single MV one, if you want. When you\u0027re ready to move on to HV recipes in the EBF, you\u0027ll want to move up to HV Energy Input Hatches, and so on.\n\nHowever, remember to keep the MV area separate from your LV area. §eHooking up an LV machine to MV current will result in the machine being destroyed! Also LV cables will burn up if you put MV current through them§r. That\u0027s why it\u0027s probably best to keep the areas separate until you\u0027re comfortable and confident with voltages. Eventually you can use transformers to switch voltages within a single setup, but don\u0027t feel forced to try that until you\u0027ve got a grasp on the basics.\n\nAll RF power is the same (it has no voltages), so you can use RF conduits to route power from wherever you\u0027re generating and storing it to §3CEFs§r for each voltage. You don\u0027t have to use this setup, but it\u0027s the most foolproof one for a beginner. And if you\u0027re an expert, well... you don\u0027t need my advice.\n\nFor your MV cables, you can use §6Copper§r to start with. §6Energetic Alloy cables§r are lossless though, so consider them if you\u0027re able to mass produce those ingots.",

The §6Launch Pad§r blocks go in a 3x3 layout flat on the ground to form the platform.\n\nThe Structure Tower§r is formed from a column of §6Structure Tower§r blocks that holds your rocket upright. The first block goes adjacent to any side of the launch pad platform (on the same Y-level as the launch pad blocks).\n\nWith 6 Structure Tower blocks, you can only build a rocket 5 blocks high, since any higher would exceed the height of the tower. To build a taller rocket, you\u0027ll need to build a taller tower using more Structure Tower blocks.\n\nThe §3Rocket Assembling Machine§r needs to be placed next to the launch pad (not on it) 1 block higher than the platform, so that the bottom of the Rocket Assembler is flush with the top of the launch pad. It also needs to be supplied with RF power to function.\n\n",

You can replace any of the hatch positions in the structure with §6LuV Machine Casings§r, as long as you have at least §atwo Fluid Input Hatches§r and §aone Fluid Output Hatch§r. It\u0027s possible to use input/output hatches in every valid location, if you prefer.\n\nBecause of this, the quest only asks for §a80 LuV Machine Casings§r. If you want to use the minimum number of fluid hatches, you\u0027ll need to craft an additional §a28 casings§r.\n\nEach §aEnergy Input Hatch§r increases the reactor\u0027s power buffer. §aAll 16 Energy Input Hatches§r are required to be able to process all Mark 1 recipes and give a power buffer of §e160M EU§r.\n\nIn addition to the recipe power drain, Fusion Reactors have a §eheat§r mechanic related to the recipe\u0027s §e\"Eu to Start\"§r. This amount of power is drained from the reactor\u0027s buffer before starting the recipe to heat up the reactor to the necessary temperature, and is independent of the recipe\u0027s EU/t cost. As such, this determines the minimum tier of reactor you need for a recipe.\n\nIf the reactor stops processing, it will §erapidly lose heat§r, even if you pause it with a soft hammer. On the other hand, if the reactor is already at the required temperature for a recipe, §eno additional power§r is required to heat up the reactor! This is true even if you switch between different recipes. This mechanic incentivizes continuous use of the reactor.\n\nIf you switch to a recipe that requires more heat, §eonly the difference§r in heat values is consumed as EU to reach the target heat (up to a maximum heat equal to the reactor\u0027s current buffer).\n\nFusion Reactors don\u0027t overclock, and they gate the next tier of materials, so you will eventually want to make more than one.",

This approach is easier but yields less Epoxy. You also forego making more diesel and getting distillation byproducts from Naphtha. If you have an extremely robust §9Oil§r drilling and petrochemistry infrastructure in place, this might be an acceptable choice.\n\nBPA can be produced using petrochemistry distillation products, or via distilling §9Charcoal Byproducts§r from your §3Pyrolyse Oven§r into useful components. Alternatively, you can get §9Phenol§r from §6Coal§r pyrolysis. §9Fermented Biomass§r is also useful to distill as it provides many useful products.

For the purposes of this particular quest, you\u0027ll be building a cheap breeder reactor to make §6Plutonium§r. This is a very basic reactor and can be changed to run faster and safer. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.\n\nFirst, set up your 54 §6Reactor Casings§r to encase a 3x3 cube shape of empty air. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 3x3 space.\n\nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in all 8 corners. Then the §6Lapis Coolers§r will go between them: 4 on the top layer and 4 on the bottom layer. At this point, the top and bottom layers should have eight blocks each with an empty middle, and the middle layer is fully empty. In the middle layer, place the 4 §6Graphite Blocks§r on the corners, and the 4 §6Glowstone Coolers§r on the sides (so they touch both Lapis Coolers). Now the cube should be full, except for an empty column in the middle. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.\n\nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.\n\nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

The first fluid you should do this with is §dMolten Creative Portable Tank§r, so you can make as many more tanks as you want! You get exactly enough from a §6Heart of a Universe§r to do this.\n\nFrom there you can set up tanks with infinite quantities of every fluid you can think of.  §3Fluid Solidifiers§r can be used to make infinite of every element you can melt and solidify.\n\nThis is quite a game-changer as far as infrastructure goes. You\u0027ll find that many machines won\u0027t need to be used for their original purpose anymore. Some major base redesign is in order. Have you considered moving to space?\n\nAll that said, §ethe pack will still be challenging to complete§r. Infinite resources and power is nice, but it\u0027s not everything. There are plenty of materials you can\u0027t melt, and creative items will push your factory automation engineering skills to their limits.\n\nOnward to the final challenge: the §dCreative Vending Upgrade§r!\n\n",

A simple recipe might consist of one package, but a complex recipe can have up to 9 packages in its set (for 81 total item stacks).\n\nThe §3Unpackager§r is a machine that extracts ingredient items from complete sets of Recipe Packages made in a Packager, ejecting the items into an adjacent inventory. It will only extract the items if §eall packages in a set are present§r.\n\nWhen both a Packager and Unpackager are connected to an ME Network and have the same recipe, the resulting item will appear as craftable in your §aTerminal§r.\n\nUp to 8 §3Packager Extensions§r can optionally be added to the Packager to speed up package creation. Place the Packager Extensions in a plane surrounding the Packager, creating a 3 by 3 structure with the Packager in the center when all 8 Packager Extensions are placed.",

But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.\n\nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no \"Gallium Ore\". You get §6Gallium§r as a byproduct from processing other ores.\n\nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you\u0027ll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §b§b§6Ore Byproduct Page§6§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing \u0027U\u0027 on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. The tooltips on a byproduct will specify what processing method is needed to obtain it.\n\nThe relevant machines are as follows:\n \n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.\n\n- §3Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. This is an improved alternative to dropping dusts in a Cauldron.\n\n- §3Chemical Bath§r: similar to a washer, but uses chemicals to purify the crushed ores. Has a chance to give a full pile of byproducts, often different than what the Washer would give.\n\n- §3§3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct.\n\n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process.\n\nThe §3Thermal Centrifuge§r, not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge, can be used for alternative ore processing but is §edreadfully slow and power-hungry§r. No LV form exists, and its primary use is for §bNuclearCraft§r fission fuels.\n\nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.\n",

A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.\n\nThere\u0027s some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won\u0027t be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn\u0027t try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first.

This opens a wheel-shaped menu displaying §especial building modes§r. With this menu open, simply move your cursor over the desired building mode and release §6Alt§r.

Next, move your cursor to another blockspace to see a preview of the final structure. §6Right-click§r again on the desired ending block to actually build the shape from blocks in your inventory.\n\nMost shapes are flat and are defined using a starting and ending location, but 3D shapes have a third location to complete the shape. Some special modes also have §eoptions§r, like making a §ehollow cube§r instead of a §efilled cube§r.\n\nIf you made a mistake, you can use the §aUndo§r button in the menu to break the blocks you just placed so you can collect them and try again.\n\nTo change building modes, just open the menu with §6Alt§r as before and pick a different one. To exit the special building modes, select the §eNormal§r mode.\n\n§cMake sure you return to Normal mode when you\u0027re done building shapes, since the special building modes will interfere with normal gameplay.§r\n\nThe size of shapes you can make in special building modes is limited by your §ereach§r, which is how far away you can click from yourself to start building, or from the previous location to complete a shape. You can craft and eat several tiers of §areach upgrades§r in succession to increase your reach to very high numbers.\n\nOverall, §bEffortless Building§r is a powerful mod that is very useful for construction.

Tools with §eEmpowered§r upgrades will be ejected into the output slots when they run out of charge (if they don\u0027t break first).

It of course works on single-block machines, but can also be used on §eMultiblock Controllers§r like your §3Electronic Blast Furnace§r. But it\u0027s even more flexible than that: you can use it on any §bGregTech§r block that accepts transfer covers, as long as the controllable cover is placed on it first! This means it also works for things like §6Chests§r, §6Drums§r, and Multiblock inputs.\n\nThe cover works by detecting a §eredstone signal§r. By default, the entire machine will be disabled if a sufficiently strong signal is detected by the cover.\n\nWhen you open the Machine Controller\u0027s GUI with a §aScrewdriver§r, you will see several options for configuring its behavior:\n\nThe strength of the signal required to trigger the Machine Controller is configurable using the top slider.\n\nAnother button allows you to select whether to control the whole machine (where applicable) or a specific cover. This lets you do things like stop moving items into a machine, but also allow the machine to continue working.\n\nSwitching from §eNormal§r to §eInverted§r mode will make the Machine Controller instead disable the machine until it receives the requisite redstone signal. This is often preferable when working with §6Level Emitters§r to prevent machines from starting up if your §eME Network§r is offline.\n\nSome use cases:\n• Control machines through vanilla redstone contraptions or a simple lever.\n\n• The §6Redstone Upgrades§r from §bStorage Drawers§r can be used when outputting into a drawer to make the drawer emit redstone that can control the machine.\n\n• When you progress to digital storage, an §6ME Level Emitter§r or §6ME Fluid Level Emitter§r can be used to emit signal based on specific items or fluids in your network.\n",

While a recipe is running, the Machine Access Interface is §elocked§r and machines cannot be added or removed.\n\nNote that each machine will still draw the full voltage required for the recipe, which may be more than a single §aEnergy Input Hatch§r can provide. This is why the §6Processing Array§r has an astounding Hatch limit, and can support up to §e8 Energy Inputs§r on the structure. This allows you to get the needed 16 Amps of power to the machine from a single tier-appropriate §3CEF§r.\n\nProcessing Arrays distribute their buffered power at the appropriate voltage, so there\u0027s no danger of your machines exploding if you, for example, operate 16 HV machines off one amp of IV power.\n\nBecause the required number of Inputs, Outputs, and Casings is highly variable, this quest only asks you to craft the §6Processing Array Controller§r and the §aMachine Access Interface§r. Make sure your buses and hatches are large enough to hold the ingredients and outputs for the number of parallel crafts you\u0027re attempting, and that you\u0027re providing enough power for all those machines!\n\nAn advanced feature of the Processing Array is §eDistinct Bus Mode§r. This makes the Processing Array only consider a single item input bus at a time when determining whether it can run a recipe. This is useful when recipes for a particular machine require different catalyst items, like §6Integrated Circuits§r on different configurations or §6Extruder Shapes§r.\n\nDistinct Bus Mode may be enabled or disabled via the Processing Array controller by clicking in the designated area.\n\n",

Clearly, this won\u0027t work for the Assembly line, since it has a whole bunch of ULV inputs buses that hold one item stack each.\n\nYou might be tempted to dump everything into a chest and route items around to specific buses with §aItem Conduits§r. You\u0027ll probably find this to be slow, prone to jamming, and inflexible when you want to run different recipes.\n\nIf you\u0027ve unlocked §3§3The Empowerer§r§r, you might have considered §aPhantomfaces§r. These would certainly be an improvement over item conduits, but there\u0027s an even better solution.\n\nEnter §aItem Laser Relays§r§r: these handy tools from §bActually Additions§r allow you to create a virtual inventory out of multiple real ones; that is, you can use them to make other automation think that all of the input buses are the same inventory.\n\n§eOne important thing to note is that lasers appear to be \"placed\" on a particular block but they will interact with all adjacent (non-laser) blocks.§r Take this into account when placing them.\n\nTo start, place a laser on each of the input buses. Then, place the §a§aItem Interface§r adjacent to the laser on the first input bus. This will serve as the access point to the virtual inventory where you can connect things like an §3Unpackager§r or §aME Interface§r.\n\nTake your §aLaser Wrench§r and right click the first laser relay, then the second laser relay, to link them together. Repeat this with the second and third relays, third and fourth relays, etc. until they have all been linked together. Now you have a laser network virtualizing all of the input buses!\n\n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network\u0027s Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r\n\nIf you need to do recipes with an §6§6Integrated Circuit§r, you can leave it in an input bus and skip placing a laser there. Remember to always use §eBlocking Mode§r when connecting the laser network to on-demand crafting. As long as you do, you can have §edifferent circuits in the Assembly Line without recipe conflicts§r. If you don\u0027t use Blocking Mode, you are likely to accidentally craft something else and jam your Assembly Line.",

This will make it far easier to generate pristine matter you\u0027ll need for things like §6Dragon Lair Data§r. You\u0027ll probably need several §3Loot Fabricators§r to keep up with it.\n\nThe data model you place in the input bus will increment the iteration count and level up the same as if it were running in a regular Simulation Chamber. §eOverclocking does not alter the chances of pristines§r: those come at fixed rates per iteration based on the level of the data model. Training a fresh data model up to Self-Aware for 30% rates can be done very quickly though.\n\nAs a §dCreative Tier§r structure, it is rather expensive to make. However, it is an investment that will easily pay for itself as you progress through the endgame. You should strongly consider making one of these with your second §dHeart of a Universe§r.\n",
